Formal Objection to Planning Application 25/02017/FUL

Applicant: Redrow Homes
Location: Land South of Chester Road, Sandiway, CW8
Proposal: Development of 112 dwellings with access, infrastructure, open space and landscaping

Date: 02/08/2025


1. Introduction

I am writing to submit a formal objection to planning application 25/02017/FUL for the development of land south of Chester Road, Sandiway. The application fails multiple key planning tests, breaches both local and national policy, and poses unacceptable risks to infrastructure, the environment, and public health.

This objection addresses:

‚Ä¢ Incompatibility with the Cuddington and Sandiway Neighbourhood Plan (CSNP)

‚Ä¢ Contravention of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF 2024)

‚Ä¢ Failures in transport, infrastructure and site integration

‚Ä¢ Environmental, health and amenity risks

‚Ä¢ Affordable housing inequity

‚Ä¢ Procedural and design shortcomings


2. Conflict with National and Local Planning Policies

Conflict with the Cuddington and Sandiway Neighbourhood Plan (CSNP)
Paragraphs 30‚Äì31 of the NPPF (Dec 2024) confirm that neighbourhood plans form part of the statutory development plan and should shape local decisions. The CSNP remains valid and up-to-date, and this application contradicts several of its core principles:

‚Ä¢ Policy D1: The development exceeds the scale and density anticipated for the area and erodes rural character.

‚Ä¢ Policy G1: The proposal fails to retain important green infrastructure and hedgerows.

‚Ä¢ Policy T1: It does not deliver realistic improvements in sustainable transport access.

Per NPPF para. 14, conflict with a neighbourhood plan is grounds for refusal, particularly where housing allocations have already been met or exceeded.


3. Loss of Agricultural Land of High Quality

Paragraph 187(b) of the NPPF instructs planning authorities to recognize the economic and environmental value of best and most versatile (BMV) agricultural land. 

The applicant‚Äôs own documentation confirms that the development site contains Grade 2 (BMV) agricultural land.

Per NPPF Footnote 65 (linked to para. 188):

‚ÄúWhere significant development of agricultural land is demonstrated to be necessary, areas of poorer quality land should be preferred to those of a higher quality.‚Äù

No justification has been given for developing high-grade land in this instance. This runs contrary to national guidance and is an avoidable and irreversible loss.


4. Transport and Highway Safety Concerns

The Transport Assessment and Health Impact Statement fail to address the full extent of traffic impacts. This site will introduce significant volumes of construction vehicles and long-term traffic onto Chester Road and Norley Road, with:

‚Ä¢ No HGV routing strategy provided for construction traffic (despite proximity to a primary schools, both of which are on potential rat runs for people trying to avoid the increased traffic).

‚Ä¢ Hourly bus service and no Sunday provision.

‚Ä¢ 1.9km walk to Cuddington Station via a poorly lit, unsuitable pavement (Norley Rd not wide enough for the potential increase in pedestrians).

‚Ä¢ A high dependency on car use, contradicting sustainable transport goals.

NPPF paras. 109‚Äì118 set a clear expectation for sustainable transport, including early engagement with the local community, pedestrian priority, and public transport integration. This proposal fails to meet those criteria.

Per para. 116:

‚ÄúDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety...‚Äù

In this case, Chester Road‚Äôs pinch points and school proximity clearly represent such a risk.

The site is physically separated from the village by a major trunk road. A pedestrian crossing will need to be constructed to allow new residents safe access to the village centre, school, shops, and amenities. However, the addition of new traffic lights in this location is likely to cause significant tailbacks in both directions. This will further increase rat-running through Weaverham Road, Gorstage Lane, Ash Road and Norley Road. The resulting congestion will make the crossroads by St John's Church more difficult and dangerous to use.

In addition, the footpath along Norley Road‚Äîused by pedestrians accessing the primary school, playing fields, and shops‚Äîis already too narrow for two people to pass safely, particularly those with pushchairs or wheelchairs. Norley Road is also a key route for accessing the railway station. An increase in vehicle traffic will render this key walking route more hazardous.


5. Biodiversity and Hedgerow Loss

The proposal results in the removal of 249m of priority hedgerow and offers only 374m of replanting, failing to meet CWAC‚Äôs expected 2:1 replacement ratio. The absence of DEFRA Biodiversity Metric 4.0 data also breaches current policy expectations.

‚Ä¢ NPPF paras. 192‚Äì193 require measurable net gain for biodiversity and safeguarding priority species and habitats.

‚Ä¢ Para. 193(a) mandates refusal where biodiversity harm cannot be avoided or mitigated ‚Äî a threshold not met here.

The application‚Äôs biodiversity entry on the planning portal specifically confirms that the proposal will not achieve the mandatory 10% biodiversity net gain uplift, further reinforcing the failure to meet statutory national standards.

Without legally binding net gain data, and with confirmation of policy shortfall, this development should not proceed.


6. Healthcare Infrastructure Capacity

The Health Impact Statement misleadingly references multiple GP practices, but Sandiway Surgery closed in 2020, and Cuddington has no remaining dedicated facility. Nearby surgeries (e.g. Danebridge, Watling Street) are already over capacity.

Per NPPF para. 101:

‚ÄúSignificant weight should be placed on the importance of new, expanded or upgraded public service infrastructure.‚Äù

No firm commitment or quantifiable S106 healthcare contribution is outlined in the application documents ‚Äî only a vague reference. Given local demand, this omission fails both NPPF para. 35 (on required infrastructure contributions) and CWAC DM29 (healthcare planning).


7. Noise, Air Quality, and Wellbeing Concerns

Noise and Mental Health

Daytime noise levels reach 67 dB, and night-time levels 61 dB, exceeding WHO guidelines (55 dB day / 40 dB night).

Health impacts include sleep disruption, anxiety, stress, and hypertension ‚Äî especially affecting children and elderly residents.

No monitoring plan or sound attenuation strategy is provided.

Air Quality

Site borders the A556, a known pollution corridor.

No real-time or baseline air quality monitoring has been submitted.

No mitigation (e.g., filtration or green buffers) proposed.


Policy reference: NPPF para. 187(e) ‚Äì Developments should improve environmental conditions such as air quality.

Thermal Comfort and Overheating

No thermal modelling included for south-facing apartments.

Risks non-compliance with Building Regs Part O and M4(2).


8. Open Space Deficiencies and Allotment Loss

The LEAP play area (128.8m¬≤) falls below the CWAC standard of 1.5m¬≤ per dwelling (i.e. 168m¬≤ for 112 dwellings). Additionally, the loss of historical allotments has not been adequately mitigated ‚Äî the proposed orchard fails to meet local policy expectations.

‚Ä¢ NPPF para. 98: Play space must be ‚Äúadequate and accessible.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ CWAC Policy DM35: Requires direct and like-for-like replacement of allotments.

The substitution is inappropriate and should be rejected.


9. Inadequate Affordable Housing Tenure Mix

The Affordable Housing Plan proposes:

‚Ä¢ 15% social rent (5 homes),
‚Ä¢ 50% shared ownership, and
‚Ä¢ No affordable rent provision.

This does not reflect local need, which leans heavily toward social rent and affordable rent, particularly for younger families and the elderly.

‚Ä¢ NPPF para. 64 requires affordable homes that are ‚Äúgenuinely affordable.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ CWAC SOC1 mandates a ‚Äúbalanced mix‚Äù based on evidence of need.

This skewed tenure profile should be grounds for refusal or major revision.

Additional concerns include:

The clustering of affordable units in one corner of the site, adjacent to the A556, which contradicts national design guidance for inclusive, tenure-blind development (NPPF para. 130(f)).

Environmental inequality: The most affordable homes are sited in the noisiest, most polluted area of the site and are furthest from green infrastructure.

Lack of clarity on delivery mechanisms, including:

Whether affordable rent will be capped at LHA rates,

Whether a Registered Provider is confirmed,

How tenure will be managed long-term.


10. Construction Traffic and Safety Concerns

The A556 is a fast-moving trunk road that already carries high volumes of freight and commuter traffic.

No clear construction management plan is presented regarding routing, timing or mitigation of Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) impacts during the build phase.

Potential safety risks to children walking to school and general public near access points and along Chester Road.

Request: A Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) must be submitted and consulted on publicly, including HGV hours, access routes and safety measures.


11. Water Infrastructure, Drainage and Flood Risk

Water Quality

The site drains toward sensitive surface water features, but no Water Framework Directive compliance assessment has been submitted.

No details are included regarding pollution control during construction (e.g., silt traps, hydrocarbon interceptors), nor for long-term runoff mitigation.


Policy Conflict:

NPPF para. 186 ‚Äì Developments must minimise pollution and adverse environmental effects.


Water Pressure and Supply

Residents in Sandiway and Cuddington already report low water pressure during peak hours.

No Water Utility Impact Assessment is included to confirm that the existing network can support the proposed 112 homes.


Policy Conflict:

CWAC STRAT10 ‚Äì Requires infrastructure capacity to match planned growth.


Flood Risk and Drainage

Despite being in Flood Zone 1, parts of the field show regular standing water, particularly in winter months.

The application lacks:

Infiltration or permeability testing results,

A SuDS hierarchy justification,

Clear maintenance arrangements for the lifetime of drainage basins.


The scheme risks exacerbating existing surface water flooding on Norley Road and Weaverham Road.


Policy Conflicts:

NPPF para. 167 ‚Äì Development must not increase flood risk elsewhere.

NPPF para. 169 ‚Äì Requires sustainable drainage with a long-term maintenance plan.


12. Development Creep and Boundary Breach

The development lies outside the village boundary, as defined in the Cuddington and Sandiway Neighbourhood Plan (Policy GS1).

Approval would set a precedent for further speculative expansion, encouraging piecemeal infill and future ribbon development along Chester Road and Gorstage Lane.

This undermines the spatial strategy that protects open countryside and directs growth to sustainable locations.


Policy Conflicts:

NPPF para. 30‚Äì31 ‚Äì Planning decisions must uphold adopted Neighbourhood Plans.

NPPF para. 15 ‚Äì Development must be genuinely plan-led.

CWAC STRAT9 ‚Äì Countryside must be safeguarded from unsustainable development.


This proposal would breach the defined settlement boundary and significantly increase the risk of future applications on neighbouring plots. The result would be unchecked development creep, contrary to both national and local planning objectives.


13. Precedent and Planning History

‚Ä¢ In 2019, a 66-bed care home proposal for a similar site on the outskirts of the village was refused due to harm to countryside character and conflict with the CSNP.

‚Ä¢ CWAC has rejected similar speculative development proposals nearby, reinforcing the inappropriateness of this location.

‚Ä¢ Approving this application would undermine consistent decision-making and set a precedent for further unsustainable development beyond the village boundary.

14. Conclusion

This application is incompatible with the strategic aims of the Cuddington and Sandiway Neighbourhood Plan, the CWAC Local Plan, and numerous provisions in the National Planning Policy Framework (Dec 2024). 

It poses clear risks to environmental quality, transport safety, biodiversity, and healthcare infrastructure.

I respectfully urge the Council to reject planning application 25/02017/FUL in its current form.
