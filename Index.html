`Dear Sir/Madam,

Please accept this as my formal objection to Planning Application 25/02017/FUL.

Name: ${name}
Address: ${address}
Email: ${email}



This proposal would breach the defined settlement boundary and significantly increase the risk of future applications on neighbouring plots. The result would be unchecked development creep, contrary to both national and local planning objectives.


13. Precedent and Planning History

‚Ä¢ In 2019, a 66-bed care home proposal for a similar site on the outskirts of the village was refused due to harm to countryside character and conflict with the CSNP.

‚Ä¢ CWAC has rejected similar speculative development proposals nearby, reinforcing the inappropriateness of this location.

‚Ä¢ Approving this application would undermine consistent decision-making and set a precedent for further unsustainable development beyond the village boundary.

14. Conclusion

This application is incompatible with the strategic aims of the Cuddington and Sandiway Neighbourhood Plan, the CWAC Local Plan, and numerous provisions in the National Planning Policy Framework (Dec 2024). 

It poses clear risks to environmental quality, transport safety, biodiversity, and healthcare infrastructure.

I respectfully urge the Council to reject planning application 25/02017/FUL in its current form.

I would appreciate acknowledgement of receipt of this email.`;
